## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x86 GNU/Linux and x86 Windows was
dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux (armv7l) will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### GNU/Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 was dropped in 2022 and the
minimum requirement was raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18, Debian 10 and RedHat 8.

## Pre-deprecation notice for Ubuntu 18.04

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS _Bionic Beaver_ reached the end of the standard five-year
maintenance window for Long-Term Support (LTS) release on 31 May 2023.

As a courtesy, the xPack GNU/Linux releases will continue to be based on
Ubuntu 18.04 for another year.

From 2025 onwards, the GNU/Linux binaries will be built on **Debian 10**,
(**GLIBC 2.28**), and are also expected to run on RedHat 8.

Users are urged to update their build and test infrastructure to
ensure a smooth transition to the next xPack releases.
